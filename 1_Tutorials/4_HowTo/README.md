# Three Ways to insert Css

### There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

## External Css

### With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file

### Each Html page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section

## Internal Css

### An internal style sheet may be used if one single Html page has a unique style

### The external style is defined inside the <style> element, the head section
## Inline Css
### An Inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element
### To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any Css property
